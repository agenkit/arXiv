The method depends on generating synthetic queries for documents using a language model (LM), and the key step is that we automatically optimize the LM prompt that is used to generate these queries based on training quality. In experiments with the BIRCO benchmark, we find that models trained with our method outperform RankZephyr and are competitive with RankLLama, both of which are 7B parameter models trained on over 100K labels. These findings point to the power of automatic prompt optimization for synthetic dataset generation. | Jasper Xian, Saron Samuel, Faraz Khoubsirat, Ronak Pradeep, Md Arafat Sultan, Radu Florian, Salim Roukos, Avirup Sil, Christopher Potts, Omar Khattab
